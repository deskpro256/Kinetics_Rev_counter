# Kinetics_Rev_counter
Custom designed counter for Kinetics Nail Systems

The problem:
For testing nail polish in the laboratory, there is a need to simulate wear of the nail polish material in time.

Kinetics needed a solution for repeatable friction setup for their nail polish degrading testing. Before this device was implemented, the tests had to be done by hand, which didn't net reproducable results, as the pressure on the test material couldn't always be the same.

This device saves time, because now there is a way to automate it.

Now the person only needs to set the wight and the amount of times to rub the material.
